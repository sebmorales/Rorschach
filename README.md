 # Rorschach
 Every night, after the day has passed in New York, a program running on
 a server with American Samoa's time logs into my Github account to check
 my daily contributions. It compares my daily performance to my expected
 performance for the day and automatically uploads changes matching the
 expected contributions. Slowly, day by day over 378 days, painting a
 picture over my Github timeline, obfuscating and questioning my role in my
 digital footprint.
