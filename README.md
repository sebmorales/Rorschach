# Rorschach
This is a 378 day long project questioning our role in our digital footprint.
Every day, a program running on a server logs into Github to check my daily
contributions. Depending on my daily activity it automatically uploads changes
adjusting my daily contributions, slowly painting a picture over my github timeline.
